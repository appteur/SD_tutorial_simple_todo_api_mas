Mobile Access Service Api - Public Interface

This is the public interface for the mobile access services api.

It is part of a tutorial series on creating an enterprise style api with a clear separation of responsibilities for all objects in the api. 

The only files and directories that should go in this directory are files that will be publicly accessible.
