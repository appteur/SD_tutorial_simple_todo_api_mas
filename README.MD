Mobile Access Service Api

This api is intended for mobile access to a simple todo list api.

It is part of a tutorial series on creating an enterprise style api with a clear separation of responsibilities for all objects in the api. There is a core layer that is part of the overall design of this api that provides services that may be shared by multiple apis.
